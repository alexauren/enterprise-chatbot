    Attempt to answer questions by iteratively evaluating the question to see what information is missing, and once all information
    is present then formulate an answer. Each iteration consists of two parts:
     1. use GPT to see if we need more information
     2. if more data is needed, use the requested "tool" to retrieve it.
    The last call to GPT answers the actual question.
    This is inspired by the MKRL paper[1] and applied here using the implementation in Langchain.
